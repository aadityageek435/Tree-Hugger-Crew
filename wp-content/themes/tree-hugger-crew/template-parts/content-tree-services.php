                        <p>While we respect and honor trees we understand there are times when tree removal is necessary due to disease, hazards, impact on other plant life, property value, safety, or aesthetics. Whatever the reason, we approach the removal of a tree respectfully. Our process involves developing a plan of removing the tree with appropriate methods, and cleaning up all resulting debris.</p>
                        <p>Through whichever method the circumstances dictate that the tree gets removed, direct felling, rigging, or mechanical, TreeHugger Complete Tree Care has the specialized equipment and accomplished arborists to complete the task in a timely and safe manner.</p>
